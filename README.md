📊 Sentiment Analysis Project
This project implements a text classification system to analyze and predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of text data using machine learning.

✅ Features
Preprocessing of text data: tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization

Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization

Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression

Evaluation of model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of confusion matrix and classification report

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

scikit-learn

pandas

nltk

matplotlib

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create a requirements.txt if not already present, e.g., with: scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, matplotlib)

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "sentiment analysis.ipynb"
Run each cell in sequence to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

📊 Results
The model demonstrates strong accuracy on the test data and correctly classifies most positive and negative samples, as visualized in the confusion matrix.

✏️ Future Improvements
Experiment with other machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).

Apply deep learning approaches such as LSTM.

Use larger and more diverse datasets.

Extend the model to handle neutral sentiment or multiclass sentiment detection.
